# Rifted Valkyrium
This is an unofficial fork of [Unvalkyried Heavens](https://github.com/LordDarthDan/Unvalkyried-Heavens) by LordDarthDan, which in turn, is a fork of [Valkyrien Skies 1](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/valkyrien-skies) by Triode et al.

This fork aims to fix some lingering issues with VS1 as well as continued maintenance of this mod for 1.12.2. This also means it's meant to be a drop-in replacement for Unvalkyried Heavens/VS1.

This fork also requires the [Cleanroom](https://cleanroommc.com/) modloader to work.

# Notable Differences with VS1 (and Unvalkyried Heavens)
* Bundle VS Core (aka this mod) back with [VS Control](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/valkyrien-skies-control) and [VS World](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/valkyrien-skies-world).
* Fix the broken rudders at last
* Cleanup some of the code and segregated some stuff meant for VS Core from VS Control

# FAQ
## Will this work with worlds that originally used Valkyrien Skies/Unvalkyried Heavens?
In theory yes. All registry names have been preserved, so you could just replace VS/UV and its submods with just this and it will all work properly.

## Will this work with other mods that have integration/manually implement compatibility with Valkyrien Skies/Unvalkyried Heavens?
Potentially no. Some classes and packages have been changed, reorganized, or removed. If a mod that used to work with Valkyrien Skies/Unvalkyried Heavens no longer works properly, report it in the issues tab.

## Why do I ned Forgelin Continuous?
The build of VS World (one of the components of Valkyrien Skies 1) used in this mod was taken straight out of the GitHub repo, which was written in Kotlin.

## Why not backport Valkyrien Skies 2/Sable instead?
I'm a really busy person irl, and somehow backporting what the aforementioned mods do from scratch will eat out most of my time ([I have like two other major projects mind you](https://github.com/Rift-Modding-Group)). Just building upon VS1 was the best logical course of action.

## Will this work with Celeritas?
Surprisingly yes. It works out of the box in fact.
